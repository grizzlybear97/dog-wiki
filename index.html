            <p>
              The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a
              domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog,
              it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf, the gray wolf is
              the dog's closest living relative. The dog was the first species
              to be domesticated by humans. Experts estimate that
              hunter-gatherers domesticated dogs more than 15,000 years ago,
              which was before the development of agriculture. Due to their long
              association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of
              domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a
              starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.

          <h2 id="2">Taxonomy</h2>
          <p>
            In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published
            in his Systema Naturae, the two-word naming of species (binomial
            nomene). Canis is the Latin word meaning "dog", and under this
            genus, he listed the domestic dog, the wolf, and the golden jackal.
            He fied the domestic dog as Canis familiaris and, on the next page,
            fied the grey wolf as Canis lupus. Linnaeus considered the dog to be
            a separate species from the wolf because of its upturning tail
            (cauda recurvata in Latin term), which is not found in any other
            canid.

            <h3>Size and Skeleton</h3>
            <p>
              Dogs are extremely variable in size, ranging from one the largest
              breeds, the great dane, at 50 to 79 kg (110 to 174 lb) and 71 to
              81 cm (28 to 32 in), to one of the smallest, the chihuahua, at 0.5
              to 3 kg (1.1 to 6.6 lb) and 13 to 20 cm (5.1 to 7.9 in). All
              healthy dogs, regardless of their size and type, have an identical
              skeletal structure with the exception of the number of bones in
              the tail, although there is significant skeletal variation between
              dogs of different types. The dog's skeleton is well adapted for
              running, the vertebrae on the neck and back have extensions for
              back muscles, consisting of epaxial muscles and hypaxial muscles,
              to connect to, the long ribs provide room for the heart and lungs;
              and the shoulders are unattached to the skeleton, allowing for
              flexibility.

            <h3>Senses</h3>
            <p>
              Dog anatomy § Senses Dogs' senses include vision, hearing, smell,
              taste, touch, and magnetoreception. One study suggests that dogs
              can feel small variations in Earth's magnetic field.[30] Dogs
              prefer to defecate with their spines aligned in a north-south
              position in calm magnetic field conditions.

            <h3>Coat</h3>
            <p>
              Dog coat The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "double"
              being familiar with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from
              colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down
              hair, or "single", with the topcoat only. Breeds may have an
              occasional "blaze", stripe, or "star" of white fur on their chest
              or underside. Premature graying can occur in dogs as early as one
              year of age; this is associated with impulsive behaviors, anxiety
              behaviors, and fear of unfamiliar noise, people, or animals. Some
              dog breeds are hairless, while others have a very thick corded
              coat. Dogs, such as the Yorkshore terrier, are selectively bred
              for their long coarse hair, which are used for esthetic.

            <h3>Lifespan</h3>
            <p>
              The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but the
              median longevity (the age at which half the dogs in a population
              have died and half are still alive) is approximately 12.7 years.
              Obesity correlates negatively with longevity with one study
              finding obese dogs have a life expectancy approximately a year and
              a half less than dogs with a healthy weight.

            <h3>Reproduction</h3>
            <p>
              In domestic dogs, sexual maturity happens around six months to one
              year for both males and females, although this can be delayed
              until up to two years of age for some large breeds. This is the
              time at which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle,
              characterized by their vulvas swelling and producing discharges,
              usually lasting between 4 and 20 days. They will experience
              subsequent estrous cycles semiannually, during which the body
              prepares for pregnancy. At the peak of the cycle, females will
              become estrous, mentally and physically receptive to copulation.

        <div>
          <h2 id="5">Behavior</h2>
          <p>
            og behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or
            inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal
            and external stimuli. Dogs' minds have been shaped by millennia of
            contact with humans. They have acquired the ability to understand
            and communicate with humans and are uniquely attuned to human
            behaviors. Behavioral scientists thought that a set of
            social-cognitive abilities in domestic dogs that are not possessed
            by the dog's canine relatives or other highly intelligent mammals,
            such as great apes, are parallel to children's social-cognitive
            skills.

            <h3>Nursing</h3>
            <p>
              The female dog may produce colostrum 1–7 days before giving birth,
              lasting for around three months. Colostrum peak production was
              around 3 weeks postpartum and increased with litter size. The dog
              can sometimes vomit and refuse food during child contractions. In
              the later stages of the dog's pregnancy, nesting behaviour may
              occur. Puppies are born with a protective fetal membrane that the
              mother usually removes shortly after birth. Dogs can have the
              maternal instincts to start grooming their puppies, consume their
              puppies' feces, and protect their puppies, likely due to their
              hormonal state. While male-parent dogs can show more disinterested
              behaviour toward their own puppies, most can play with the young
              pups as they would with other dogs or humans. A female dog may
              abandon or attack her puppies or her male partner dog if she is
              stressed or in pain.

            <h3>Intelligence</h3>
            <p>
              Researchers have tested dogs' ability to perceive information,
              retain it as knowledge, and apply it to solve problems. Studies of
              two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by inference. A study with
              Rico, a Border Collie, showed that he knew the labels of over 200
              different items. He inferred the names of novel things by
              exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those new items after
              four weeks of the initial exposure. A study of another Border
              Collie, Chaser, documented that he had learned the names and could
              associate them by verbal command with over 1,000 words.

          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Communication</h3>
            <p>
              Dog communication is how dogs convey information to other dogs,
              understand messages from humans, and translate the information
              that dogs are transmitting.  Communication behaviors of dogs
              include eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture
              (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory
              communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). Dogs mark their
              territories by urinating on them, which is more likely when
              entering a new environment. Both sexes of dogs may also urinate to
              communicate anxiety or frustration, submissiveness, or when in
              exciting or relaxing situations. Aroused dogs can be a result of
              the dogs' higher cortisol levels. Between 3 and 8 weeks of age,
              dogs tend to focus on other dogs for social interaction, and
              between 5 and 12 weeks of age, they shift their focus to people.
              Belly exposure in dogs can be a defensive behavior that can lead
              to a bite or to seek comfort.
